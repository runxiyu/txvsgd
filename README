I think we should use the Wiki for stuff, that'd allow more people to
contribute casually.  I'll port this book there.

Yes, the Wiki (https://learn.tuxiversity.org/) is mainly server-hosting
related things now, but it doensn't have to stay this way.  I think
digital skills and other Free Software/Hardware related stuff
could/should be there too.
